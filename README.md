# loss-subspace-geometry

Exploring geometry of low loss neural network subspaces

## Setup

Please install libraries in the `requirements.txt` file using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Use of virtual environments is optional but recommended. For GPU support refer to [the PyTorch docs to ensure correct the CUDA version](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
